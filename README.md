ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Miro and I fell in love with data analytics.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m also highly interested in Machine Learning. I started my journey with DataQuest where I learned the foundations of data analytics. 
Thanks to DataQuest gained solid knowledge of Python programing language, which I constantly developing by studying more materials. 
After completion of this comprehensive "quest", I dived deeper into this beautiful area.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking another course called DeepLearning by Andrew Ng.
